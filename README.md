# Virtual Mouse using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI
This project implements a virtual mouse using a webcam, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI. The virtual mouse moves the cursor based on hand gestures detected through the webcam, allowing you to control your computer's cursor with your hand.

# Features
Hand Tracking: Uses MediaPipe to detect and track hand landmarks.
Cursor Control: Moves the cursor on the screen according to the index finger's position.
Click Simulation: Simulates mouse clicks when the index finger and thumb are close together.
# Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
MediaPipe
PyAutoGUI
